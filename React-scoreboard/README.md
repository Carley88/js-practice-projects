# React - Scoreboard

A simple app to practice using React. 

The app allows users to keep score on a game they are playing. The app allows users to:
/Add and remove players.
/Displays number of players - this automatically increases and decreases    when the players are edited. 
/Increase and decrease their scores.

I have used http-server to test this locally.
